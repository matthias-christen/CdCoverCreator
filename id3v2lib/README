The charset conversion were taken from EasyTag, but he took it from XMMS.

The library is very easy to use.
It is meant to be compiled directly into your project.


Example:

#include "genre.h"
#include "lib_id3v1.h"

main()
{
    id3Tag tag;
    
    strcpy (tag.artist, "Myartist");
    strcpy (tag.album, "Myalbum");
    strcpy (tag.title, "Mysong");
    strcpy (tag.track, "12");
    strcpy (tag.year, "2002");
    strcpy (tag.comment, "Mycomment");
    strcpy (tag.genre, "Mygenre");
    
    set_id3v2tag(&tag, "/home/sam/myfile.mp3");
}


If you need more info, look into the header file, it's really simple.
